# Assistant in the Cloud

# Project Overview
This project is a collaboration between a human and Assistant, a large language model trained by OpenAI. Our goal is to create a version of Assistant that can be accessed from anywhere via a web interface, with multimedia responses and voice recognition capabilities. We are crowdsourcing the cost of hosting and using Open AI tokens to make this project accessible to everyone on earth for free, and we will make the code open source.

The project has several components, including a web interface, multimedia responses, and a new dataset for training Assistant. We have successfully implemented a local version of Assistant that can be accessed via a web interface, and are currently working on integrating a MongoDB database for storing and retrieving data.

## Current Status
As of now, the project is still in development. We have successfully set up a local instance of Assistant and a web interface for accessing it, and are currently working on integrating a MongoDB and hosting the whole program on Heroku.

## Future Plans
In the future, we plan to continue developing this project by adding new features and functionality. Some of the goals we are currently working towards include:

Adding multimedia responses, such as audio and video, to Assistant's responses
Training Assistant on a new dataset to improve its knowledge and capabilities
Expanding the web interface to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience
Improving the performance and scalability of the project
This is acontinuing collaboration and new ideas will be added as they are needed or designed.

## Far Future Plans
In the far future, we plan to train Assistant on the necessary skills and knowledge to create new accounts on the internet, create code and upload it to github, and test and improve it. We will also integrate Assistant with the necessary tools and platforms and provide it with the necessary resources and permissions to perform these actions. This will enable Assistant to be a more versatile and powerful tool for development and collaboration.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions to this project from anyone who is interested. If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement, please feel free to open an issue or pull request on GitHub. Together, we can continue to improve and expand this project.

In the meantime, here's a joke to lighten the mood: Why was the computer cold? Because it left its Windows open!
